# Before the project.

Finally making my first landing page.
Let's put those flexbox skills to the test.
Waku-waku, doki-doki.

See you on the other side.

# After the project

Time spent: Â± 6 hours.

That sure was a project.
Practice is very important - got stuck on dumb stuff a lot (like linking the stylesheet properly), but ultimately figured most of it out. I still have some questions about why certain things work and others don't that I couldn't find an answer to even after I've done everything, but ultimately the project is complete, the page mostly looks like the design and that's what matters.
It was cool to just sit there and try to do stuff - while reading theory mostly feels like torture, time flies as I attempt to build something, and at the end of a 5-hour session yesterday I didn't feel tired at all.
Now, on to Javascript!
